# Inclusive Elements

**Sensible, reusable implementations of common UI controls.**

- **ðŸ¦® Accessible.** Elements follow the [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices) so everyone can use them.
- **ðŸŒ³ Lightweight.** 3kB gzipped in total. Less if you tree-shake only the parts you need.
- **ðŸŽ¨ Unstyled.** Style them bottom-up rather than top-down.
