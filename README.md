# Inclusive Elements

**Accessible, lightweight, unstyled implementations of common UI controls.**

[**Demo**](https://tobyzerner.github.io/inclusive-elements/index.html)

Basic interactive UI patterns like popup menus, tooltips, and modals are surprisingly hard to get right on the web. Component libraries tend to be weighty, opinionated, and come tightly coupled with styles you don't want. On the other hand, rolling your own components feels like you're reinventing the wheel and puts accessibility at risk.

`inclusive-elements` provides those basic behaviors in the form of Custom Elements, without any of the cruft. They are:

-   **ðŸ¦® Accessible.** Designed following the [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) so everyone can use them.
-   **ðŸŒ³ Lightweight.** 3kB gzipped with minimal dependencies. Less if you tree-shake only the elements you need.
-   **ðŸŽ¨ Unstyled.** Easily integrate with your design bottom-up without having to fight defaults.
-   **ðŸš€ Easy to use.** Simple API, works with any framework that supports Custom Elements.
